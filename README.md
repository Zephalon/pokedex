# Pokédex

A custom Pokédex made with React.js

## Scraping

To avoid any legal issues you'll have to scrape the (possibly) copyrighted content from Pokewiki. Just run the `artwork.py` script once to set everything up.

    pip install beautifulsoup4
    cd scraper
    python artwork.py

## Development

    npm start
... and...
    npm run build
