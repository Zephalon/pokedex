# Pokédex

A custom Pokédex made with React.js

## Scraping

To avoid any legal issues and to keep the Pokédex up-to-date, you'll have to scrape the copyrighted content from Pokewiki. Just run the `pokewiki.py` script once to set everything up.

    pip install beautifulsoup4
    cd scraper
    python pokewiki.py

## Development

    npm start
... and...

    npm run build
